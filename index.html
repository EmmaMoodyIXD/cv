      I am a Full-time Undergraduate Student at Ulster University enrolled on the 2020 Interaction Design course.
      I am currently learning Full-Stack Web Development on Udemy from the amazing Dr Angela Yu. Developer and Lead Instructor at the London App Brewery.
      <br><br><br><br>
      The reason I decided to build this website, is because I want to learn how to build a website from the ground up, and not need to rely on a professional web builder to do so.
      I also want to gain a greater understanding and appreciation of how websites are made and hope to build an awesome website by the end of my online Udemy course. This will be my first experimental website.
      In the future, I would love to design and build solutions to problems that have not yet been tackled or can be improved.
      <br><br><br><br>
      I feel excited to learn something that I'm passionate about. My childhood has been heavily influenced by technology.
      It feels incredible to learn what my heroes used to create their own successful businesses.
      <br><br><br><br>
      I first got introduced to technology as a child from my first ever gaming console - a Nintendo DS Lite. This is what led me to fall in love with art and technology.
      <br><br><br><br>
      My greatest strengths are problem-solving and creative thinking.
      My greatest weaknesses are focusing too much on one thing and losing track of time.
      <br><br><br><br>
      I recently completed my A-Levels in Mathematics, Digital Technology and Art.
      For my Art A-Level, I decided that my final piece would be a website.
      The concept of the website was to build a digital portfolio of my artwork. I successfully built this concept using a handy web builder.
      The website showcased my A-Level art and experiments, using a modern approach to traditional art.
      <br><br><br><br>
      I hope to become an independent multidisciplinary designer for the digitally influenced future,
      combining knowledge from both a logical and creative-thinking perspective, to tackle complex problems of today.
      <br><br><br><br>
      And I hope to become successful, achieving my goals!
